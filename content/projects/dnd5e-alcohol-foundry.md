DnD5e Alcohol is a module for the TTRPG software FoundryVTT that adds alcoholic beverages to the game.

Working on this project was my first foray into a larger JavaScript ecosystem…


The module is based on a great, free [ruleset by CupidFaust on GMBinder](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-M0rTarrzYJgR5jiH0j6)
that I converted with their blessing.
