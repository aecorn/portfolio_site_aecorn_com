I was very impressed of how adaptable, humble and inventive everyone was, how easily the communication, github and other worked flowed. We early on defined \"data-interfaces\" (see green and blue points in the architecture slide) where parallell work was possible before and after these layers, so we could often split the team into 2-3 smaller groups while working.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/articles/hack4ssb_2025/ssb_vektor_architecture.jpeg\" alt=\"Architecture of the VektorVikings solution\"></p>\n<h2>Our project:</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Build a vector-embedding‚Äìbased search across SSB‚Äôs content (articles + one 140-page PDF for the hack).</li>\n<li>Wrap it in an API that not only serves search + full documents, but also exposes an MCP server so an AI/LLM can use it as tools.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"/articles/hack4ssb_2025/ssb_vektor_distance.jpeg\" alt=\"The search with distance\"></p>\n<h2>The Techstack</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Own code and Docling for data-collection , -filtering and -unification <a href=\"https://github.com/docling-project/docling\">Docling Github</a></li>\n<li>NB-SBERT-BASE from the AI-lab at the Nasjonalbiblioteket | The National Library of Norway used for doing the vectorization <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/nasjonalbiblioteket-the-national-library-of-norway/\">Linkedin page of National Library</a></li>\n<li>The extension sqlite_vec and sqlite to create a .db file. <a href=\"https://github.com/asg017/sqlite-vec\">Sqlite Vec Github</a></li>\n<li>FastAPI + FastAPI-MCP to host the API that distributes the database's content <a href=\"https://github.com/tadata-org/fastapi_mcp\">FastAPI MCP Github</a></li>\n<li>A demo website for search, copying the design of ssb.no, turned into a jinja-template also hosted by another fastapi-instance.</li>\n<li>We demoed the MCP using Claude locally on the desktop (we generated an http-stdio bridge using AI, so that Claude works even without a subscription).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>üèÜOh, and yes.
