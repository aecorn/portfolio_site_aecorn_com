# My personal homepage 
This is the source code for my personal homepage. It is built using React, Tailwind CSS, and framer-motion. It showcases my projects, blog posts, and provides a way to contact me.
Articles and projects are written in Markdown and frontmatter is parsed using gray-matter.
The site fetches data from Pypi and GitHub to display information dynamically.
