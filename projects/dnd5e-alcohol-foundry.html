        <p>
            DnD5e Alcohol is a module for the TTRPG software FoundryVTT that adds alcoholic beverages to the game.

        <p>
            Working on this project was my first foray into working within a larger javascript ecosystem.
            FoundryVTT has a vibrant community on discord, but the development speed is so high that the documentation is lacking at time (which they admit freely).
            I learned, and am still learning about hooking into the FoundryVTT API, other modules. 
            Seeing users actually start using the module, and especially getting issues on the repo back from them, with wishes and bug reports can be fulfilling and engaging.
            Being able to respond is very tightly coupled to my free time, but I try to respond as quickly as I can.
            I am learning things about myself as well, how my motivation ebbs and flows, and how its connected to the feeling of mental load, and how it can be recharged with a short period of "boredom".

        <p>
            The module is based on a great, free 
            <a href="https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-M0rTarrzYJgR5jiH0j6#:~:text=Once%20your%20Alcohol%20Level%20is%20equal%20to%20one%20half%20of,Wisdom%20checks%20and%20saving%20throws">ruleset by CupidFaust on GMBinder</a>
            that I converted into a FoundryVTT module with his (or her) blessing.
